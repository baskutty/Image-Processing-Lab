1.a.
Frequency domain is obtained after taking DFT. The white corner represents the higher frequency changes.
1.b.
MOD of fourier transform is magnitude spectrum. More intense than fourier transform image. This due to taking mod while in fourier only real part was displayed.
1.c.
Angular values of fourier transform ie. tan ^-1 of imaginary part/real part and displayed taking exponent to avoid negative.
1.d.
Has more intensity than the magnitude spectrum before.
1.e.
An image similar to the orginal image is obtained after taking IDFT of the fourier.
1.f. 
Magnitude spectrum is obtained after removing phase spectrum from DFT so we take inverse of magnitude spectrum.
