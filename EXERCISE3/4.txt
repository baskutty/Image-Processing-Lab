  
  X(ω)=∫∞−∞x(t)e^(-iωt)dt  (1)
  x(t)=1/2π*∫∞−∞X(ω)e^(iωt)dω  (2)
replacing t with -t in (2)
  x(-t)=1/2π*∫∞−∞X(ω)e^(-iωt)dω (3)
  ∫∞−∞X(ω)e^(-iωt)dω =Fourier transform of X(ω) (4)
  X(ω)=Fourier transform of x(t) (5)
 Therefore from (4) and (5) (3) becomes 
x(-t)=1/2π* Fourier transform of (Fourier transform of x(t))

Its the same for DFT
 
So if DFT is applied two times in succession we get an reversed image.
