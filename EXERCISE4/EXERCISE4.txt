WALSH:
Coefficients near origin are having the maximum energy and as you go away from the origin the energy of the coefficients reduces.But here the energy compaction property is not strong.
Small energy compaction

HADAMAND:
Here the energy is concentrated more towards origin compared to the Walsh transformation.
Energy compaction higher than Walsh

HAAR:
Energy compaction higher than hadamand.


DCT:
In the case of discrete cosine transformation,the energy is concentrated in a small region in the coefficients space near about the origin.
Energy compaction is high.Greater than HAAR

KL:
Energy compaction is highest for Karhunen-Loeve

Best for Compression:
HAAR transform is the best for compression because haar transform has the lowest file size.
