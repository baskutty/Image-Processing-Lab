Question 1:
In log function the darker pixels get expanded and the lighter pixels get compressed thus highlghts the darker pixels.As sigma value increase the darker pixel get more expanded.

In exp function its the opposite of the above thus increases the contrast of the given image.As sigma value increases contrast increases.



Question 3:
The darker image's histogram is pushed to the left along the pixel intensity axis compared to the original image's histogram.

After equalization the pixel intensity is distributed in the range (0,255)



Question 5:
Median filtering replaces a pixel value with the median of pixel value of neighbors.It is a smoothening filter thus blurs the image and is used for removing noise.

Min filter replaces a pixel value with the minimum of pixel value of neighbors.It distorts the image.It makes dark pixel values thicker.

Max filter replaces a pixel value with the maximum of pixel value of neighbors.It blurs the image.It makes dark pixel values thinner.


Mean filter replaces a pixel value with the mean of pixel value of neighbors.It is a smoothening filter thus blurs the image blurring effect is high.



Question 6:

Sobel filter uses first order derivatives it highlights the edges of an image.
Prewit filter is similar to sobel, uses first order derivatives it highlights the edges of an image.
Laplace filter is a second order derivative filter it higlights the edges of an image precisely.




Question 7:

In ideal lowpass filter for D0=10 blurring is very high D0=60 blurring is less than before and D0=460 blurring is the least.

In Guassian lowpass filter for D0=10 blurring is very high D0=60 blurring is less than before and D0=460 blurring is the least.

In Butterworth lowpass filter for D0=10 blurring is very high D0=60 blurring is less than before and D0=460 blurring is the least.

This is because as D0 increases more part of image is filtered out thus reduces the blurring.
